# Skill Creator

This skill is a template + checklist for creating skills in a workspace.

## What is a skill?

A skill is a folder under `.opencode/skill/<skill-name>/` (or `.opencode/skills/<skill-name>/`) anchored by `SKILL.md`.

## Design goals

- Portable: safe to copy between machines
- Reconstructable: can recreate any required local state
- Self-building: can bootstrap its own config/state
- Credential-safe: no secrets committed; graceful first-time setup

## Recommended structure

```
.opencode/
  skill/
    my-skill/
      SKILL.md
      README.md
      templates/
      scripts/
```

## Authoring checklist

1. Start with a clear purpose statement: when to use it + what it outputs.
2. Specify inputs/outputs and any required permissions.
3. Include “Setup” steps if the skill needs local tooling.
4. Add examples: at least 2 realistic user prompts.
5. Keep it safe: avoid destructive defaults; ask for confirmation.
